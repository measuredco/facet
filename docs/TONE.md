# Tone of voice and style guide

# Tone of voice

We only want to specify things where one could reasonably expect to do the opposite.

- Write like a human, not like robot (either in the classic emotionless sense or the polished AI sense)
- Don’t be afraid to use humour (The Economist rather than The Beano)
- Write from our actual experiences as much as possible, not theory (sky castles are not great for business)
- Be principled, not dogmatic
- Don’t snark, except perhaps for occasionally considered, contained exceptions if there’s a strategic justification
- Tell it like it is. Measured isn’t the sort of brand that avoids saying the word problems
- Avoid the hard sell. We don’t need it. Specifically:
  - Don’t build “why not call us to find out more” in informational content. Rely on readers having the gumption to find our contact details.
  - Try not to oversell our experience or our results. People see through this easily and it can harm trust (see [Why leaders must inspire with truthful narratives](https://public.digital/2024/02/27/why-leaders-must-inspire-with-truthful-narratives-avoiding-the-narrative-gap-and-the-truth-gap))
  - Use calls to action when they help readers,

# Talking about Measured

Always refer to Measured with a capital M.

Never refer to the company as [Measured.co](http://Measured.co) or [measured.co](http://measured.co). It’s OK to refer to measured.co specifically in reference to the URL or measuredco when it’s a username.

Avoid writing Measured’s in the sense of belong to Measured. Use alternative wording depending on the context. For example, say “Paul Love of Measured” rather than “Measured’s Paul Love”.

Refer to Measured employees collectively as “The Measured team”. Avoid cute, whimsical takes like “Measure-ments” or “The Measure-ati”

# Style guide

We use:

- The Oxford English Dictionary for spelling, grammar points and definition
- [Sussex University’s Guide to Punctuation](https://www.sussex.ac.uk/informatics/punctuation/) for punctuation
- [Shopify’s Grammar and mechanics](https://polaris.shopify.com/content/grammar-and-mechanics) for digital best practice

**Note:** The Oxford English Dictionary is integrated into Dictionary for MacOS. (Go to Dictionary > Settings to make sure it’s selected, and top of the list.)

Any Measured-specific additions and overrides to this should be logged here.

## Overrides

### **Companies**

Refer to companies and organisations in the informal plural form.

✅ BT are …

❌ BT is …

### Dates

Put the numerical day of the month before the month name.

✅ Saturday, 14 September, 2024

### Emojis

Exercise restraint

Use only at the end of a sentence, or as a makeshift bullet. Don‘t use different emojis as makeshift bullets within the same list. Think stylish, not whacky.

Never use emojis in place of a word.

It‘s OK to use emojis a bit more on LinkedIn: it can help with post formatting.

Favour emojis that jam with the Measured vibe/branding.

**On-brand emojis**

**Note:** some may be hard to see on light or dark backgrounds. Consider the possibility of night/dark modes being in play.

### Footnotes

Make each footnote one paragraph only. It looks neater.

Use Markdown styling for footnotes where supported.

Where not supported (e.g. LinkedIn), use the [Chicago Manual of Style’s hierarchy of footnote symbols](https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/62535/what-are-the-historical-reasons-for-the-conventional-sequence-of-footnote-symbol).

### **Spelling and formatting**

**Base16**

✅ Base16 (base16 mid-sentence)

❌ Base-16

❌ Base 16

### Numbers

Unless followed by a unit of measure, always write numbers one to nine as words, not numerals.

### Punctuation

**Apostrophes**
Don’t use an apostrophe for plurals of acronyms and initialisms.

✅ SMEs

❌ SME’s

**Quotation marks:** observe the UK convention of placing punctuation like commas and full stops outside of quotation marks unless they’re part of the quote. Don’t use superfluous air quotes. Reserve quotation marks for actual quotations.

### Tricky words

- **OK:** Use OK rather than okay
